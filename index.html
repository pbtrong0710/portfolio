        <h2>"Hello world!"</h2>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Southern Vietnam. I came to the States for
          high school and university more than 10 years ago. At the moment, I'm
          currently located in Las Vegas, Nevada.
        </p>
        <p><em>Best activities while in Las Vegas:</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Watching shows, concerts</li>
          <li>Eating at world-renowned restaurants</li>
          <li>Visiting many famous national attractions</li>
          <li>Last but not least, of course gambling!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Don't worry! My passion is not gambling, but it's software developing.
          Nice to meet you all!

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Not so many people are aware of this fact, but growing up, I've had a
          fair shares of "dream jobs". Though I've never seriously put much
          thoughts into them, they will forever remain as my true interests.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Commercial pilot</li>
          <li>Chef</li>
          <li>Comedian (most surprising?)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          My major was not computer science. It was actually business
          administration. I used to think that I love running and managing a
          business of my own, but not until after I graduated, I had found out
          that this wasn't the case. I love working with people, but not as much
          as working with computers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides my interest in computers and technology in general, I would
          say a big factor that really pushes me to switch career and pursue the
          "software engineer" dream is the ideal life of having ultimate
          freedom, travelling the world and exploring different cuisines (I'm a
          foodie!). With that being said, If I'm able to land a remote position
          in any tech company, that would be amazing! I get to travel and work
          at the same time!
